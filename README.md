# CISC4305_Final_Project
CISC 4305, Algorithms and Data Structures Final Project, IKGContacts

CISC 4305
Project (50 Pts)
Due Date: Last Day of Classes at 11:59 PM Central (MyCampus)

Project overview:
In Computer Science, searching and sorting are the two most frequently performed tasks
by professionals and end users alike. For instance, when you type a search key word on the
web, thousands of online documents are searched and entries matching the key word are
returned most likely sorted in the order of relevance or via other criteria. When an
admission officer at a college/university wants to see the names of all the incoming
freshmen, s/he may want to have access to all the students whose classification is freshman.
Bursar’s office may be interested in knowing all the students whose fees have not been
paid in full. These are just few examples.

Professor Gang, being the friendly person that he is, has been struggling with how to keep
track of his friends, acquaintances, family members, and colleagues. Furthermore, he
frequently meets people but quickly forgets relevant information (name, nationality,
profession, email, etc.). As a senior Computer Science Major, who just completed Data
Structures and Algorithms, he turned to you (team of 2) to resolve this problem. You are
to develop a software application named IKGContacts that accepts (either from key board
or input file) a Title, full name, nationality, state, country (of residence), email, phone, and
race. Your software should incorporate a functionality to use any of the 8 fields as a
sort/search criteria. For instance, I should have the freedom to sort the data by emails
(ascending order), title, state, etc.

Tips to getting started:

     Get your team together and share this exciting news
     Put together a project plan after getting specifications (see above)
     Devise a schedule, including team meetings, and note the due dates.

Project details:

    Project assignments will be performed according to the groups formed in the class. Group
    members will be asked to rate the level of effort expended by other team members.
    Results may be used as a factor in determining an individual’s project grade.
    
Teams are expected to perform the following as minimum requirements:

     Create a master document (Word or PDF) that addresses and explains all the major requirements.
     Partition the work among the two team members
     With respect to Software Life Cycle (development, use and maintenance) list and discuss all of the key software
      development phases (Analysis, Design, Implementation, and Testing – ADIT) that you team undertook in completing
      this project (include pictures and diagrams when necessary).
     Be prepared to submit your project no later than 11.59 PM on the last day of classes.
     See “Project Guidelines” for specific deliverables.

Project Guidelines and Deliverables

     Showcase your understanding of the key topics learned over the semester:
    
        a. Demonstration your understanding of lists
        b. Demonstrate your understanding of pointers
        c. Demonstrate your understanding of searching/sorting algorithms
        
     Project Deliverables include:
    
        a. Project file that include all the associated files (Word/PDF, Image, UML, etc.)
        b. Various development phases (see Programming Example on page 576)
        c. Diagrams or images
        d. Any other items your team used in the project planning and implementation
        phase (a-d must be included in a zip folder).
        
     NO LATE PROJECTS OR PROJECT PIECES WILL BE ACCEPTED. NO SECOND CHANCES FOR WRONG PROGRAM/PROJECT,
        NON-WORKING PROGRAM, OR MISSING PIECE, WILL BE GIVEN.
     One team member may submit your project
     See the Grading Rubric for Point Value:
     All diagrams must include at least:
    
        a. Name and purpose
        b. Clear relationship to the project and requirements
